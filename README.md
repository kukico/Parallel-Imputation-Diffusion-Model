## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of the **Parallel Imputation Diffusion Model (PIDM)** proposed in the paper. PIDM is designed for imputing missing values in medical time series, particularly under **high missing rates** and **long sequences**, while ensuring **clinical fidelity**.  

Key features:  
- **Parallel diffusion framework** for long-sequence imputation.  
- **Dynamic Programming Alignment (DPA)** to ensure smooth reconstruction of full sequences.  
- **Clinically Relevance Curve (CRC)** evaluation to assess physiological plausibility beyond standard statistical metrics.  
- Validated on intracranial pressure (ICP) recordings from **CHARIS** and **KCH** datasets.

## ðŸ”§ Installation  

Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PIDM.git
cd PIDM
```

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage  

The whole codes are provided in PIDM.ipynb as jupyter notebook.

## ðŸ“Š Results  
PIDM achieves:  
- Superior **DTW alignment** compared to baseline models.  
- Clinically faithful reconstructions validated with **AMP** and **HFC** indices.  
- Flexible adaptation to variable missing lengths (see Appendix I of the paper).  

Please refer to the paper for detailed results.
